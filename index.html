    Project 3: Cinemagraphs

    Is it a photo? Is it a video? The world may never know. But here's what we do know: A cinemagraph is an animated GIF or video of a still photo in which a movement occurs - think of it like an image that contains a living moment within itself. The cinemagraph concept was created by
    <a class="link" href="http://cinemagraphs.com/about/"> Visual Graphics Artist Kevin Burg and photographer Jamie Beck </a> who had a desire to communicate more to viewers in an image and capture the essence of a moment in time.
    <br>
    We were motivated to do this project because we've seen it widely used on platforms like Tumblr and think it's #hella cool to mix static and dynamic elements into one form, and we too are #helluva (creative) engineers. We went around Barcelona, taking videos of our favorite spots, being sure to capture a specific moving subject that we wanted to isolate. We converted the video into a GIF and designed a mask that separated what we wanted to freeze and what we wanted to remain animated.

    These are the general steps we followed:

    <p>
    </p>

    1. Film a video.

    <p>
    </p>

    2. Convert video to a GIF.

    <p>
    </p>

    3. Select a frame from the GIF and generate the mask.

    <p>
    </p>

    4. Use the mask to freeze a region of the GIF and keep movement on another region.

    </p>

    We obtained the final cinemagraph by blending the original clip with the "masked" clip. The full code can be found <a class="link" href="cinemagraphs.py"> here</a>. Here is some example output that we got:
